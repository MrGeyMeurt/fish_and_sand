# *Fish&Sand*

## Overview
In Fish&Sand, you control a fish navigating dangerous underwater territories dominated by a relentless shark. Your objective is to evolve, collect pizzas, and use your dash ability to find a way out before the shark catches you.

## Game Mechanics
### Evolution System
- **Pizza Collection:** Gather pizzas scattered throughout the underwater world to evolve your fish.
- **Evolution Levels:** There are 3 evolution levels.
- **Shark Spawns:**
  - Each time you reach a new evolution level for the first time, an additional shark spawns, increasing the danger.
- **Escape Condition:**
  - When you collect 2 pizzas (max evolution level), you unlock the escape route through the big container.
  - Entering the container ends the game with a successful escape.

### Shark Mechanics
- **Persistent Pursuit:** The shark continuously chases you.
- **Consequences of Being Caught:**
  - Lose one evolution level when caught.
  - If you're at level 1 and get caught, the game ends.

### Dash Ability
- **Activation:** Press Escape on the keyboard or X on a PlayStation controller to dash forward.
- **Cooldown & Stacks:**
  - 6-second cooldown
  - Maximum of 2 dash stacks
- **Usage:** Use the dash to quickly escape danger or traverse areas rapidly.
- **Haptic Feedback:** Dashing triggers controller vibration for tactile feedback (controller only).
