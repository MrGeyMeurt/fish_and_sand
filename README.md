## Description
*Project Poisson* is a minimalist underwater adventure game inspired by Untitled Goose Game. In this student project, the player controls a small fish. This project is developed in Unity with C#, utilizing Blender for 3D assets, following a low-poly style with flat colors for an immersive, simplified aesthetic.

## Project status
- **Brainstorming**: Defining the general concept (genre, theme, art style).
- **Game Mechanics**: Discussing simple gameplay mechanics (platformer, puzzle, racing, etc.).
- **Target Audience**: Considering the target audience and the project's complexity.

## Features
- **To-do List**: The player completes a single task at a time, such as moving an object from point A to point B.
- **Camouflage**: The player can hide near seaweed to avoid detection by the shark.
- **Shark AI**:
  - The shark moves randomly but will chase the player if they come close.
  - After completing a task, the shark follows the player for 3 seconds before returning to random movement.
- **Sound and Vibration Cues**:
  - An alert sound plays when the shark is close to the player.
  - The controller vibrates if the shark is close to the player.
- **Environmental Interaction**: The fish can pick up and carry objects, adding an interactive element to tasks.

## End-Game
Once all tasks are completed, the fish reaches the coral reef, escapes the lagoon, and gains freedom in the open sea.

## Technologies Used
- **Game Engine**: Unity
- **Programming Language**: C#
