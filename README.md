# *Fish & Sand*

## Description
*Fish & Sand* is a minimalist underwater adventure game inspired by Untitled Goose Game. In this student project, the player controls a small fish. This project is developed in Unity with C#, utilizing Blender for 3D assets, following a low-poly style with flat colors for an immersive, simplified aesthetic.

## Project status
- **Game Mechanics**: Initial gameplay mechanics are under development, including movement, interactions, camera setup, and basic physics.
- **Temporary Asset Creation**: Basic models are created in Blender (characters, environments) to test integration.

## Features
- **To-do List**: The player completes a single task at a time, such as moving an object from point A to point B.
- **Camouflage**: The shark cannot detect the player if the player is near seaweed.
- **Shark AI**:
  - The shark moves randomly but will chase the player if they come close.
  - After completing a task, the shark follows the player for 3 seconds before returning to random movement.
- **Sound and Vibration Cues**:
  - An alert sound plays when the shark is close to the player.
  - The controller vibrates if the shark is close to the player.
- **Environmental Interaction**: The fish can pick up and carry objects, adding an interactive element to tasks.

## End-Game
Once all tasks are completed, the fish reaches the coral reef, escapes the lagoon, and gains freedom in the open sea.

## Technologies Used
- **Game Engine**: Unity
- **Programming Language**: C#
